## How to run
The provided solution to the 2024 CapitalOne Software Engineering, Summer Intern position is written in Javascript. Intended to run with NodeJS, simply type node 'Christopher Long.js' in the console to run the program. The input is hard coded into the program as per OA specifications. The output is also to the console, and displays both the maximum number of points a user would receive with the provided rules and sequence of transactions, as well as the number of points they earned eith each additional transaction. That is, if the total points a user has after transaction `TO1` is 625, and the total after transaction `T02` is 837, the transaction point log will show that `T02` earned the customer 212 points to accumulate to the total of 837.
